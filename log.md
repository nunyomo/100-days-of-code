**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

### Day 3: January 8, Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** Created VSCode workspace after installing python extension. Working in this IDE now. Running through tutorials. Created 1CharacterInput.py to "Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old." Created 2OddOrEven.py to "# Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user."
**Thoughts:** New workspace is good.
